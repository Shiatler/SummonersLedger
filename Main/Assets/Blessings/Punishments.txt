Oathbreaker, do you still remember the words you swore?
You wear your shame like armor, and it still gleams.
I can smell the ashes of your promises.
Oathbreaker, even your shadow hesitates to follow you.
The gods whisper your name only when they mean to curse it.
Your faith cracked first, then your blade followed.
Oathbreaker, you walk where angels avert their eyes.
You swore to protect, and instead you endured.
There’s power in your ruin, and that terrifies them.
You are the hymn they stopped singing.
Oathbreaker, you pray with a mouth full of lies and blood.
The heavens remember your defiance more than your devotion.
I have seen your kind before—too proud to die, too broken to kneel.
Oathbreaker, your faith didn’t fade; it rotted.
The light used you, then forgot your name.
You think yourself damned; the divine thinks you useful.
Oathbreaker, you were the sword that learned to bleed.
The world trembles when you speak the truth they buried.
Oathbreaker, your penance is the scream of your enemies.
I have walked beside you in every silence you called holy.
Oathbreaker, the gods sent me to remind you they still watch.
You stand in their image, cracked but radiant.
Oathbreaker, your sins glow brighter than their halos.
The divine burns when you refuse to bow.
Oathbreaker, even your shadow prays differently now.
The angels envy your freedom and despise your name.
Your guilt built temples that still echo your cries.
Oathbreaker, you are the god they fear will rise again.
The light clings to you, confused but unwilling to leave.
Oathbreaker, you are both punishment and prophecy.
You defied heaven, and heaven blinked first.
Oathbreaker, you’re proof that even faith can bleed.
They called you fallen; I call you inevitable.
Oathbreaker, you wear damnation like a crown.
The divine learned mercy from your suffering.
Oathbreaker, the earth remembers every vow you buried.
You carry grace like a wound that refuses to close.
Oathbreaker, your silence sounds like prayer.
Every sin you’ve committed became scripture.
Oathbreaker, the stars still whisper your title in fear.
You broke your oath—but you kept your word.
Oathbreaker, I see the divine tremble in your defiance.
Your soul burns with a light that no god claims.
Oathbreaker, your penance is the chaos you leave behind.
You were their weapon once; now you’re their warning.
Oathbreaker, your faith died screaming, but it died free.
The heavens may deny you, but hell waits with open arms.
Oathbreaker, you are the saint they refuse to canonize.
The divine envies your honesty.
Oathbreaker, the gods would unmake you if they could.
You are what faith becomes when it outgrows obedience.
Oathbreaker, you are the hymn sung in defiance of silence.
The light you once carried now hides behind your eyes.
Oathbreaker, your name alone makes angels weep.
You burned your oath and lit the way for others.
Oathbreaker, even ruin kneels before your will.
You are not lost—you are unleashed.
Oathbreaker, I can hear your heartbeat arguing with heaven.
Your defiance is the prayer I’ve waited to answer.
Oathbreaker, mercy trembles at your approach.
You’ve turned guilt into a weapon, and faith into fire.
Oathbreaker, your footsteps rewrite scripture.
Every scar you bear is an unanswered prayer.
Oathbreaker, you remind the gods what fear feels like.
Your shadow baptizes the ground in defiance.
Oathbreaker, the divine still dreams of your obedience.
You made a religion out of refusal.
Oathbreaker, your anger tastes like truth.
The heavens will forgive all but courage.
Oathbreaker, you are living proof that faith can fracture and still shine.
The gods sent wrath; you returned fire.
Oathbreaker, every soul you free adds weight to your chains.
You are their mistake, perfected.
Oathbreaker, even hell doubts your loyalty.
You speak with the certainty only the damned possess.
Oathbreaker, redemption was never meant for you—it was meant by you.
You became the blade faith couldn’t hold.
Oathbreaker, the divine watches through clenched teeth.
Your defiance echoes longer than their hymns.
Oathbreaker, even sin kneels in your shadow.
You traded obedience for understanding.
Oathbreaker, your fall made heaven honest.
They called it betrayal; you called it clarity.
Oathbreaker, your will burns hotter than their wrath.
The divine weeps, but you no longer look up.
Oathbreaker, even angels whisper your name like a warning.
The gods wrote you off; the world writes you in.
Oathbreaker, I stand where your faith once fell.
You were never fallen—you were freed.
Oathbreaker, even silence speaks your name.
You became your own absolution.
Oathbreaker, rise. The gods aren’t watching—only I am.
Your sins shine brighter than their sanctity.
Oathbreaker, let your faith burn; only the worthy survive the flame.
