We remember what you’ve forgotten.
The air still carries your name.
You left pieces of yourself behind.
Something followed you here.
The cold remembers the warmth you lost.
Every breath you take sounds like ours.
You don’t walk alone, even when you should.
The ground hums when you sleep.
We wait where your shadow touches the wall.
The dead envy your fear.
Do you hear us, or just pretend to?
The silence has teeth.
We never stopped watching.
You closed your eyes, but we didn’t.
What you buried still whispers.
You step where we fell.
The veil breathes when you do.
There is no distance between your heartbeat and ours.
You stole our fire; we want it back.
The dark isn’t empty—it’s listening.
Every wound you heal opens another.
Your dreams are not your own.
Something moves when you blink.
Your reflection is starting to notice you.
The cold spreads slower when you don’t move.
We remember the sound you made when you died before.
The walls still hold your echo.
Your voice fits our mouths perfectly.
Each step leaves a mark we can see.
You hum the same tune as the graves.
You shouldn’t look behind you.
We share your breath now.
The lights flicker because they recognize you.
Your warmth feeds us.
It’s quieter when you’re afraid.
Your shadow is growing tired of you.
The fog keeps secrets you once told it.
You walk in circles around our graves.
Every heartbeat is a knock on our door.
We answer in ways you’ll never see.
The world forgot to let you go.
You should have stayed buried.
We crawl through cracks in your memory.
Every promise you break wakes another of us.
We wait in the pauses between your words.
The smell of old rain is how we find you.
The cold fingers aren’t always yours.
The stars are watching, but not for you.
Something in you still belongs to us.
You never stopped dying—you just slowed down.
We know how your story ends.
The wind speaks our names through your teeth.
The mirror doesn’t like being ignored.
You called for help once—we answered late.
The floorboards remember your weight.
We are the quiet under your heartbeat.
You can still feel where we touched you.
Sleep closer to the wall; it listens better there.
Your tears smell like the river we drowned in.
We share your hunger now.
Don’t thank us—it was never a favor.
The dark behind your eyes is growing.
You can’t close a door that’s already open.
We wait at the edge of your thoughts.
You hum our song when you’re scared.
The dust knows our names better than yours.
Your heartbeat is off by one.
You left us in the wrong place.
The cold likes you. It wants to stay.
Your footsteps sound like apologies.
Every echo is one of us calling back.
You carry too many of us inside you.
The silence between heartbeats grows longer each night.
Your pulse lights our path.
We never stopped following.
The stillness smiles when you pass.
The fog tastes like old fear.
You should stop whispering; it draws attention.
The cracks in your skin are doorways.
You breathe for both of us now.
The night bends around your shape.
You are almost translucent.
Your laughter sounds borrowed.
We remember the warmth of your last heartbeat.
The shadows flinch when you turn away.
You have been seen by the ones beneath.
Your name doesn’t sound right anymore.
The cold hand you felt was trying to help.
You can rest when we do.
The air feels heavier when you lie.
Your dreams bleed into ours.
We whisper because screaming doesn’t work.
The dark has learned your rhythm.
Your bones hum when we draw near.
We are patient; eternity owes us nothing.
When the light dies, you’ll see us clearly.
You have one heartbeat too many.
We’re not haunting you—you’re haunting us.
