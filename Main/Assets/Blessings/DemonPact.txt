You came looking for power, not truth.
Every oath begins with a whisper and ends with a scream.
You signed before reading the last line.
Your soul is a fine currency.
We like those who don’t hesitate.
You asked for strength; the price was never hidden.
You already belonged to us when you started wanting more.
Names are just contracts waiting to happen.
The ink is still wet, Summoner.
We heard your wish long before you said it.
Every victory you claim writes another clause.
The flame in your chest burns with borrowed fuel.
You call it ambition—we call it hunger.
We don’t steal souls; we lease them.
The taste of power lingers longer than guilt.
You can’t unmake a bargain sealed in your own blood.
The devil never knocks—he’s already inside.
We like you better desperate.
The more you take, the less of you remains.
You’re easier to love when you’re doomed.
We offered power; you offered everything else.
Hell keeps good records.
Your heart beats in infernal time now.
Every favor we grant tightens the chain.
You begged once, and we never forgot.
Freedom is just another term in the contract.
We only take what you agree to lose.
Your soul fits the mold perfectly.
The Ledger bleeds when you sign.
We admire your confidence—it seasons the soul nicely.
You were born for this arrangement.
We don’t tempt; we clarify.
Every wish is a nail in your coffin of choice.
Your shadow owes us interest.
You’ve mistaken consent for control.
The smell of burning parchment suits you.
We offer everything but mercy.
Your will is the sweetest part to break.
You’ll thank us when the power stops hurting.
Every deal ends with applause—ours, not yours.
You think you summoned us; we called you first.
The strongest chains are made from promises.
You pray upward, but your answers come from below.
Hell’s door never closes, only waits.
We sell nothing you didn’t already crave.
You’ve met our kind before—you just called them teachers.
The fire in your eyes looks good on you.
We can make the world kneel, if you’re willing to join it.
There’s no such thing as too late—just more expensive.
You’re not damned; you’re drafted.
Demons don’t lie—we edit.
Your spine will do nicely for the next signature.
We never forget a debtor.
The first taste is always the sweetest.
Your ambition writes faster than your hand.
The ashes on your tongue are payment pending.
The best bargains end in silence.
Hell doesn’t burn—it remembers.
You wanted eternity; we gave you relevance.
Your courage makes the fall entertaining.
We prefer our heroes slightly broken.
The glow you feel isn’t pride—it’s ownership.
You can’t drown the voice that taught you to swim.
Every pact is a mirror held too long.
You wanted to matter; now you do—to us.
The price of power is always exact.
We love mortals who read between the screams.
Your blood carries our signature now.
We take nothing that wasn’t already promised.
The Ledger of Hell has your handwriting.
You won’t miss what you never understood.
Power is addictive because it’s familiar.
We don’t corrupt—we fulfill.
The flames only hurt until you stop resisting.
Your faith was the down payment.
We admire your dedication to self-destruction.
The world bends easiest around the damned.
You call it a deal; we call it destiny.
Each spell you cast signs again in smaller print.
You’re not trapped—you’re employed.
Hell’s interest rates are eternal.
We gave you wings once; you chose the fall.
The silence after your name is the contract closing.
We own the echoes you leave behind.
You asked for more—we are more.
The circle you drew was also a door.
Your heart beats in infernal rhythm now.
We don’t take souls; we harvest potential.
The bargain doesn’t end when you stop breathing.
You’ll outlive your regrets, but not us.
Power without consequence is our best illusion.
Every deal begins with trust and ends with laughter.
You can’t buy your way out—you already spent yourself.
We never lose, we just wait.
You aren’t cursed—you’re claimed.
The fire whispers your name correctly now.
You’re halfway to greatness, and all the way ours.
We don’t punish sinners—we hire them.
You wanted to be remembered; Hell remembers everything.
