You see how vessels, summoners, tavern and merchants spawn to the side? WOuld it be possible to have bosses spawn in the middle of the road looking down at you? 

They should spawn following your score, so if u hit 5000 points it spawns further ahead (far enough away so you cant see on map)

Then next boss 12500 (Also bosses should give more Score than normal)

So 5000, 10.000 (+5000) and then between 5000-10000 after that, example could spawn after 15.000 could also spawn after 18.000, the 5000 to 10.000 stick for the rest of the game. 

Boss sprites are found here: C:\Users\Frederik\Desktop\SummonersLedger\Main\Assets\SummonersBoss

BSummonerF1-3.png BSummonerM1-8.png Cnythia.png and Master_Oak.png

They will follow same random name logic, if male or female 

Cynthia will be named Cynthia and will spawn after 50.000 points, Master Oak named Master Oak after 100.000 points

The first boss will always have 3 vessels in party (random vessels)

Next boss 5 vessels

Rest of the bosses 6 vessels

Use Summoner_Battle.py + Battle.py for battle logic etc 

Fx (Boss spawns, you walk close, Summoner_Battle.py plays with the boss sprite - screen changes to Battle.py (Same as normal summoner battles) Uses the random team that was generated for set boss. 

Go ahead and write me a plan first, not too long - then after we can see if I implement or not.

Forgot to mention, music for bosses are different than normal summoner battle music C:\Users\Frederik\Desktop\SummonersLedger\Main\Assets\Music\Boss Boss1.mp3 and Boss2.mp3



Update plan

Boss System Implementation Plan (Updated)
1. Boss Spawning Logic (world/actors.py or new world/bosses.py)
Track score milestones: [5000, 12500, 15000-18000 (random), ...] with special at 50000 (Cynthia) and 100000 (Master Oak)
On milestone: spawn boss ahead (middle of road, far enough to be off-screen)
Store boss data: sprite path, name, party size, score threshold
Boss faces player (sprite orientation)
2. Boss Data Structure (in GameState)
active_bosses: list[dict] with {pos, sprite_path, name, gender, party_size, score_threshold, team_data}
Generate team when boss spawns (3/5/6 vessels via existing team randomizer)
Store team in boss data for battle consistency
3. Boss Rendering (main.py or world/actors.py)
Draw bosses centered on road (not offset like merchants)
Use sprite from Assets/SummonersBoss/ based on gender/name
Check distance to player; when close, trigger encounter
4. Encounter Trigger (main.py)
On proximity: set gs.encounter_type = "BOSS", load boss sprite/name
Call summoner_battle.py with boss data (reuse existing flow)
Transition to battle.py with pre-generated boss team
5. Boss Music (systems/audio.py or combat/summoner_battle.py)
Boss encounters use Assets/Music/Boss/Boss1.mp3 or Boss2.mp3 (alternate or random)
Normal summoner battles keep existing music
Play boss music when boss encounter starts, stop on battle end
6. Score Rewards (systems/points.py)
Boss multiplier: boss_points = base_points * 2.5 (or similar)
Award bonus on boss defeat
7. Boss Name Generation (systems/name_generator.py)
Reuse existing name logic for male/female
Override: "Cynthia" at 50k, "Master Oak" at 100k
8. Integration Points
Check score in main loop; spawn bosses when thresholds hit
Boss proximity detection in overworld update
Reuse summoner_battle.py → battle.py flow with boss music
Files to modify/create:
world/actors.py (or new world/bosses.py) - spawning
main.py - boss rendering & encounter trigger
systems/points.py - score milestone tracking
combat/summoner_battle.py - boss encounter handling & music
systems/audio.py - boss music loading/playback
Should I proceed with implementation?
