“Ahh… there you are! So you must be {player_name}, yes?
I’ve been expecting you.

I am Master Oak, keeper of the Ledgers and chronicler of those who dare to wield them.

Before you are 3 vessels.
These Vessel once walked the world as heroes, long before our time.

Choose carefully, Summoner.
Every choice you make together will write another page in the story of this world.

The path ahead is not a gentle one. Across these lands wander other Summoners — each bound to their own echoes, each chasing power, glory, or redemption.

To rise above them, you must seek out and capture more Vessels, master their will, and prove your bond stronger than theirs.

In time, perhaps your name will be etched among the greats…
a Summoner whose Ledger reshaped the fate of the realm itself.”
